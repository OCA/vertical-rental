This module activates availability checks on stockable products related to rental services in
sale orders. In the base functionality only the total amount of products in stock is checked and user is

After the installation of this module the availability is checked in consideration of the total amount

In case of insufficient products in stock the user receives visual notification on respective sale order line
and can access the list of concurrent sale orders directly.
