In the menu *Sales > Products > Product Variants*, on the form view of a stockable product or consumable, in the *Sales* tab, there is a button *Create Rental Service* which starts a wizard to generate the corresponding rental service.

In the menu *Inventory > Configuration > Warehouse Management > Warehouses*, on the form view of the warehouse, in the *Technical Information* tab, you will see two additional stock locations: *Rental In* (stock of products to rent) and *Rental Out* (products currently rented). In the *Warehouse Configuration* tab, make sure that the option *Rental Allowed* is checked.

To use the module, you need to have access to the form view of sale order lines. For that, users must be part of the group *Manage Product Packaging*. To add all your users to that group, go to the menu *Inventory > Configuration > Settings*: in the *Products* section, enable the option *Product Packagings* and click on *Save* (this is done for you upon module installation).
