The off-days can only be used for products rentable in days.

Create a rentable product and its rental service for daily rentals:
 * Go to Rentals > Configuration > Settings.
 * Please activate the checkbox for using 'Product Variants'.
 * Go to Rentals > Products > Products.
 * Create a new storable product.
 * Active the checkbox 'Can be Rented'.
 * Go to page 'Rental Price'.
 * Activate the boolean fields for daily rental.
 * Add a usual price for one day.
 * Save the product, which creates the related rental service.
 * Add bulk prices as desired, e.g. one day costs 300 €, 7 days 290 €, 21 days 250 €, and so on.
 * Adjust its stock in location 'Rental In'.

Create a rental order:
 * Go to Rentals > Customer > Rental Quotations.
 * Create a new order and choose the type 'Rental Order'.
 * Add the rental service as an order line.
 * Set the quantity to rent out one or several storable rentable products.
 * Choose start and end date, e.g. for 3 weeks.
 * On the order line you will see a page 'Off-Days' at the bottom.
 * Choose the type 'Weekend' in order to create 'Fixed Off-Days' and you get a list with all saturdays and sundays within the rental period.
 * Add some additional off-days as needed.
 * The number of off-days reduces the rental quantity and is therefore not included in price calculation.
 * Confirm the order.
