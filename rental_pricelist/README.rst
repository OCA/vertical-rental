Usage
=====

Create a rentable product:
 * Go to Rentals > Configuration > Settings.
 * Please activate the checkbox for using 'Product Variants'.
 * Go to Rentals > Products > Products.
 * Create a new storable product.
 * Active the checkbox 'Can be Rented'.

 Configure the naming of rental services:
 * Go to Settings > Users & Companies > Companies.
 * To to page 'Rental Services'.
 * Configure the rental service names by providing a prefix and suffix for the name and default code.

 Create the rental services:
 * Go to the previously created rentable storable product.
 * Go to page 'Rental Price'.
 * Activate the boolean fields for hourly, daily or monthly rental as needed.
 * Save the product, which creates the related rental services for the given time units.
 * Add a usual price for one hour, one day or one month.
 * Add bulk prices, e.g. one day costs 300 €, 7 days 290 €, 21 days 250 €, and so on.

Hint: The (bulk) prices are added in the product form view of the storable, rentable product
but are actually used for its related rental services!

Create a rental order:
 * Go to Rentals > Customer > Rental Quotations.
 * Create a new order and choose the type 'Rental Order'.
 * Choose the storable rental product (not the rental service!).
 * Choose the rental time unit, which actually loads the correct related rental service.
 * Set the quantity to rent out one or several storable rentable products.
 * Choose start and end date.
 * Confirm the order.
 * Check out the two deliveries, one for outgoing and one for incoming delivery.
